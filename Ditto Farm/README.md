# Intro
This method is probably the most profitable in terms of pure net profit, but selling the Dittos is super time consuming. Dittos without 31 IV stats need to be sold too, and both listing on the GTL and selling boxes is tedious. 

Still a very fun method. Repeat Balls are slightly superior to Ultra Balls. You can buy Repeat Balls in Hoenn, in the Rustboro PokeMart (after you receive a Repeat Ball on Route 116 from the Devon Employee).
