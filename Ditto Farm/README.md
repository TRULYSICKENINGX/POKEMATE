# Intro
You need to have the E4 beaten in Hoenn, then start in the PC facing the nurse in Fallabor Town.

You can buy Repeat Balls in Hoenn, in the Rustboro PokeMart (after you receive a Repeat Ball on Route 116 from the Devon Employee).

This method is probably the most profitable in terms of pure net profit, but selling the Dittos is super time consuming. Dittos without 31 IV stats need to be sold too, and both listing on the GTL and selling boxes is tedious. 

Still a very fun method. Repeat Balls are slightly superior to Ultra Balls. You can buy Repeat Balls in Hoenn, in the Rustboro PokeMart (after you receive a Repeat Ball on Route 116 from the Devon Employee).

# Expected Payout
Quite complex and RNG reliant, will update this later (I estimate something like 100k-150k per hour).

# Setup
The setup for this method is the most complex. 

Note: You need Dig and Teleport Ocarinas, as otherwise Assist can call these moves. I would recommend buying them off the market (you can also modify the script to walk out instead, but it is slower).

The most efficient way to currently farm good Dittos is to have:

1. Lead Pokemon (I use Espeon) with the Synchronize skill and a desirable trait like Adamant (this will give you roughly a 15% extra chance for Dittos to be Adamant)
2. A "CATCH" Smeargle, ideally level 100 that ONLY knows False Swipe and Assist
3. A "SLEEP" Pokemon, Smeargle or other, that ONLY knows Spore
4. The rest of your party should be full of Dittos (because Assist calls other moves in your party, and it cannot call Transform)

**To make your Pokemon forget moves, talk to the Grey Haired Move Maniac in most Poke Centers**

The fight plays out as follows-

1. Lead Pokemon switches out instantly for the "CATCH" Smeargle (Synchronize trait needs to be lead for it to work)
2. "CATCH" Smeargle uses False Swipe, bringing Ditto to 1 HP
3. "CATCH" Smeargle uses Assist, calling Spore (since it's the only callable move in your party)
4. The script will throw two Repeat Balls, then loop steps 3 and 4

Once Ditto is caught the battle will end. 

# Instructions
Set your total Repeat Balls available, as well as any hotkeys (Bike, Dig, Teleport).

Make sure your Synchronize Pokemon is your lead, CATCH Smeargle second, and SLEEP Pokemon third. You want Dittos to fill up the rest of your party, I recommend catching them manually first then script farming.

Go to Fallabor Town's PC and start inside, next to and facing the nurse. 

Run!
