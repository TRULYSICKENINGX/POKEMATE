# Intro
This script uses Pay Day to farm Smeargles in Artisan Cave (Battle Frontier, Hoenn Region). 

You need to have the E4 beaten, then look up a guide on how to get to Artisan Cave (you have to get a Wailmer Pail from a flower shop to get rid of the Sudowoodo).

This is probably the most efficient use of Pay Day currently available.


# Expected Payout
The payout for this method is a bit on the lower side, but it is very simple and the area is not as populated as some of the other places (maybe safer?).

Also, you accrue currency directly.

You can expect to earn approximately 70k per hour with a Pickup Meowth, after subtracting Leppa Berry costs.

# Setup

For effective use, you need a lv. 100 Meowth or Persian with Pay Day (PP Maxed) and full IV/EV Attack. 

Having a Meowth is more efficient, as you can get one with the Pickup trait to farm some extra items.

Set your Pay Day Pokemon as your lead, and make sure Pay Day is the first move.

# Instructions

Once in Artisan Cave, go anywhere on this red line.

Set hotkeys according to the script as well as your total leppa berries available (minus 10, in case of issues).

Start script!
