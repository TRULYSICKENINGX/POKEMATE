# Intro
This script uses Pay Day to farm Smeargles in Artisan Cave (Battle Frontier, Hoenn Region). 

You need to have the E4 beaten, then look up a guide on how to get to Artisan Cave (you have to get a Wailmer Pail from a flower shop to get rid of the Sudowoodo).

This is probably the most efficient use of Pay Day currently available.


# Expected Payout
The payout for this method is a bit on the lower side, but it is very simple and the area is not as populated as some of the other places (maybe safer?).

# Setup

For effective use, you need a lv. 100 Meowth or Persian with Pay Day (PP Maxed) and full IV/EV Attack. 

Having a Meowth is more efficient, as you can get one with the Pickup trait to farm some extra items.
