Every script:
1. Has shiny detection (will afk for 24 hours until you manually catch the shiny)
2. Will run until you run out of required items (Repeat Balls, Leppa Berries), or until you set a stop point
4. Will relog and reset to fix positional errors (will also do every few hours to avoid detection)

Setup instructions are in each respective folder (still updating these).

#Artisan Pay Day
A very consistent and effortless method as currency is directly acquired. Need a level 100 Meowth or Persian with Pay Day and high Attack IV/EV. 

~$75k an hour with Pickup Meowth, almost zero RNG

#Cerulean Thief
Based on Fiereu's initial version, this performs similarly but uses Teleport to GoBackToPC. Additionally, it has relog features, and will attempt to hard reset once in a while to ensure things are running smoothly.

~$90k an hour, RNG dependent

#Ditto Farm
Uses Repeat Balls, Synchronize, and a "CATCH" and "SLEEP Pokemon to efficiently farm good Dittos. This method has a difficult setup, and Dittos are very tedious to sell, but the payout is good.

~$130k an hour, but this is VERY RNG dependent and is difficult to estimate
