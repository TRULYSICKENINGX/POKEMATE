# Intro
This is very similar to Fiereu's initial script. The only thing you need is access to Cerulean City in Kanto, one Shuppet, Sweet Scent, Cut and Teleport (Pokemon or Ocarina).

It uses a Shuppet with Frisk and Thief to farm Meowth's near Cerulean City, and is designed to run for long durations (I've hit thousands of encounters with no issues):

To do this, the script does a hard reset and logout both every few hours and when a positional error is met.

# Expected Payout
This is RNG dependent, but I estimate about 90k an hour.

# Setup
1. Low Level Shupet (I prefer lv 1) with Frisk Ability and Thief move
2. Cut on Hotkey 7
3. Teleport on Hotkey 8
4. Sweet Scent on Hotkey 9

# Instructions
1. Set values in the beginning of the script (SweetScentPP, PokemonID, PokemonName)
2. Go back to the PC, face the nurse, and start!
